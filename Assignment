After installing all the yaml files present in k8-specifications using the command kubectl apply -f . all the necessary pods were created
After a few seconds all the pods were up & in running state
kubectl get pods 
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-mgz7g        1/1     Running   0          34s

Voting can be done at http://13.212.46.234:31005/
Voting result can be seen at http://13.212.46.234:31010/

Initially there are not 0 votes, so the result page shows "No votes added yet"

Observations after deleting pods
1. After deleting vote pod - kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-bxctq
Both front end & unix continued to work
Reason - Since we had set replicas=1 which means even if a pod is deleted it automatically creates another pod, so both result & voting pages showed no difference or very minute difference, over all behavour of the app remains same, unaltered.

[root@ip-172-31-1-189 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get pods 
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-mgz7g        1/1     Running   0          11m
redis-868d64d78-ltn88     1/1     Running   0          11m

worker-dd46d7584-4w8lw    1/1     Running   0          11m

2. After deleting worker pod - kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-4w8lw
App still works fine, a different worker pod with different id is seen, because of the same reason that replica set in deployment is 1, app behaviour is unaltered.
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-mgz7g        1/1     Running   0          13m
redis-868d64d78-ltn88     1/1     Running   0          13m
result-5d57b59f4b-mv4qw   1/1     Running   0          13m

worker-dd46d7584-72l8w    1/1     Running   0          15s

3. After deleting db pod  - kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-mgz7g 
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-g4vwm        1/1     Running   0          39s
redis-868d64d78-ltn88     1/1     Running   0          15m
result-5d57b59f4b-mv4qw   1/1     Running   1          15m
vote-94849dc97-svcm2      1/1     Running   0          3m29s
worker-dd46d7584-72l8w    1/1     Running   1          87s

Observation:
a. After deleting the DB pod db-b54cd94f4-q4dk8, new db pod got added db-b54cd94f4-g4vwm and the RESTARTS value of result and worker pods are changed to 1.
b. All the previous results are cleared
c. Scaling was performed to increase the replicas value to 3, so that even if a single pod is deleted it there are 2 pods on stand by & the app is up & running continuously.
